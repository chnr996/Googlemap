It looks like you've provided both HTML/JavaScript code and PHP code for geocoding addresses using Google Maps and OpenStreetMap APIs. The HTML/JavaScript code allows users to input an address and retrieve its coordinates from both Google Maps and OpenStreetMap, while the PHP code defines classes that implement a GeocodingService interface for fetching coordinates from these services.
